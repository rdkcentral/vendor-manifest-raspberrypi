## Quick Start

> Use a release **tag** for stable builds or `develop` for the latest development branch.

```bash
repo init -u "https://github.com/rdkcentral/vendor-manifest-raspberrypi/" -b <tag-or-branch> -m rdke-raspberrypi.xml
repo sync
```

---

## Setup IPK Feeds

IPK feeds are required for package installation and dependency resolution in downstream layers. You can configure local (file-based) feeds or remote feeds.

> ⚠️ **Important:** When using a local file feed, include the `file:/` prefix and make sure the path ends with a trailing `/`.

### Configure OSS IPK Feed

Edit the file:
```
rdke/common/meta-oss-reference-release/conf/machine/include/oss.inc
```

Set the feed path (example):
```bitbake
OSS_IPK_SERVER_PATH = "file:/${HOME}/community_shared/rdk-arm64-oss/<OSS-IPK-Version>/ipk/"
```

---

## Build Environment

Initialize your build environment for the Raspberry Pi 4 (64-bit) server:

```bash
MACHINE=raspberrypi4-64-rdke source ./scripts/setup-environment
```

Enable generation of a deployable IPK feed during the build:

```bash
echo 'DEPLOY_IPK_FEED = "1"' >> conf/local.conf
```

When enabled, the build will produce `Packages.gz` for each architecture in:
```
./build-raspberrypi4-64-rdke/tmp/deploy/ipk/
```

---

## Building Targets

Choose one (or both) of the following targets depending on your goal:

- **Vendor layer IPK feed** (produces IPKs consumed by downstream layers):
```bash
bitbake lib32-packagegroup-vendor-layer
```

- **Bootable vendor test image** (wrapper that builds a bootable image including vendor packages):
```bash
bitbake lib32-vendor-test-image
```

✅ At least one of the above must succeed to produce a usable IPK feed. Ideally both should succeed.

The generated IPKs are located at:
```
./build-raspberrypi4-64-rdke/tmp/deploy/ipk/raspberrypi4-64-rdke-vendor/
```

---

## Deploying IPK Feed

Copy or sync the generated IPK feed to your shared/local repository path:

```bash
rsync -av ./build-raspberrypi4-64-rdke/tmp/deploy/ipk/raspberrypi4-64-rdke-vendor/*  ~/community_shared/raspberrypi4-64-rdke-vendor/<OSS-IPK-Version>/ipk/
```

After syncing, confirm the `Packages.gz` files and directory layout are correct for the consumers of the feed.

### Notes

- **IPK feed not found by consumers**  
  Verify `OSS_IPK_SERVER_PATH` has `file:/` prefix and a trailing `/`. Confirm `Packages.gz` exists for each arch.

- **Paths with spaces**  
  Avoid spaces in file-system paths for feeds. Use underscores `_` instead.

## Example: Building from `develop` Branch or Release tag `V4.6.0`

A fully copy-paste example to build from `develop` or Release tag `V4.6.0`:

```bash
# Option A: Building from release tag V4.6.0
repo init -u "https://github.com/rdkcentral/vendor-manifest-raspberrypi/" -b refs/tags/4.6.0 -m rdke-raspberrypi.xml

# Option A: Building from develop Branch
repo init -u "https://github.com/rdkcentral/vendor-manifest-raspberrypi/" -b develop -m rdke-raspberrypi.xml

repo sync
MACHINE=raspberrypi4-64-rdke source ./scripts/setup-environment
echo 'DEPLOY_IPK_FEED = "1"' >> conf/local.conf

# Option A: Build vendor IPK feed
bitbake lib32-packagegroup-vendor-layer

# Option B: Build bootable vendor test image
bitbake lib32-vendor-test-image
```
